# Sliding Window Algorithm

The sliding window algorithm is a technique used to efficiently solve problems that involve arrays or lists. It works by maintaining a subset of elements within a window that slides over the data structure to find an optimal solution.

## When to Use Sliding Window

- **Fixed-size window**: When you need to process or analyze a fixed-size subset of elements in an array or list.
- **Dynamic-size window**: When the window size can change based on certain conditions or constraints.
- **Contiguous sub-arrays**: When the problem involves finding or optimizing contiguous sub-arrays or sub-lists.

## Tips for Recognizing Sliding Window Problems

- The problem involves a sequence (array, list, string) and requires examining all possible sub-arrays or substrings.
- You need to find the maximum, minimum, or optimal value within a sub-array or substring.
- The problem can be solved by maintaining a running total or other aggregate information as you iterate through the sequence.

Examples of problems that can be solved using the sliding window technique include finding the maximum sum of a sub-array of a given size, longest substring without repeating characters, and minimum window substring.
